			<p>
				Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a love for creating innovative digital 
				solutions. My journey in technology began several years ago, and since then, I've been 
				constantly learning and evolving with the ever-changing landscape of web development.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I specialize in modern web technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, Svelte, SvelteKit, 
				and various backend technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating 
				user experiences that are both functional and delightful.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source 
				projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community. I'm always excited to take on 
				new challenges and collaborate on interesting projects.
